TODO list for WBox

== HTTP CLIENT MODE ==

High priority

. $HOME/.wboxrc
. Computer parsable output "type:reply|len:3234|time:3424|code:200..."
. Write min/avg/max time on Ctrl+C and every N lines of output

Low priority

. Ability to follow links can be interesting, for example to generate a map
  of the site, check for broken links, and so on.
. "color" option to use terminal colors to make the output more readable

== HTTP SERVER MODE ==

High priority
. Handle zero length (/proc filesystem is a good example) files

Low priority
. Ability to "bind" commands to specific urls. For example using something
  like 'wbox servermode /tmp/foobar bindurl /uptime uptime" should show
  the uptime command output accessing http://127.0.0.1:8081/uptime.
  Multiple binds should be possible at the same time.
. A special 'servertest' mode implementing a select(2) or pthread based
  server with minimal overhead serving a static page (the user should
  be able to set the length of the generated page). This mode should be
  useful in order to benchmark a server theoretical limits serving
  pages of the given size.
